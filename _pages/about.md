Welcome! <br>

I am a sixth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Northwestern University.
My research focuses on development economics and energy economics, with particular interest in how resource scarcity and energy access affect economic inequality in developing countries.

I am on the 2025/2026 job market.
